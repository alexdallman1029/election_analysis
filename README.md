# Colorado Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
An employee from the Colorado Board of Elections was interested in an automated way to analyze data from a congressional election.

The Colorado Board of Elections wanted the followng tasks completed:

1. Calculate total number of votes cast.
2. Determine all candidates votes were cast for.
3. Calculate total votes and percentage of total votes received by each candidate.
4. Calcuate the winning candidate based on the popular vote.
5. Determine all counties votes were cast in.
6. Determine vote count for each county.
7. Determine percentage of votes for each county.
8. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Election Audit Results
### Resources 
Python 3.6.7 was used to analyze the voting data. Visual Studio code 1.63.2 was used as a text editor. The data source used was [election-analysis.csv](election-analysis.csv). 

### Methods

The following is the code, written in python.

```python

# Add our dependencies.
import csv
import os

# Add a variable to load a file from a path.
file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", "election_results.csv")
# Add a variable to save the file to a path.
file_to_save = os.path.join("..", "election_results.txt")

# Initialize a total vote counter.
total_votes = 0

# Candidate Options and candidate votes.
candidate_options = []
candidate_votes = {}

# 1: Create a county list and county votes dictionary.
county_options = []
county_votes = {}

# Track the winning candidate, vote count and percentage
winning_candidate = ""
winning_count = 0
winning_percentage = 0

# 2: Track the largest county and county voter turnout.

largest_voting_county = []
largest_county_count = 0
largest_county_percentage = 0


# Read the csv and convert it into a list of dictionaries
with open(file_to_load) as election_data:
    reader = csv.reader(election_data)

    # Read the header
    header = next(reader)

    # For each row in the CSV file.
    for row in reader:

        # Add to the total vote count
        total_votes = total_votes + 1

        # Get the candidate name from each row.
        candidate_name = row[2]

        # 3: Extract the county name from each row.
        county_name = row[1]

        # If the candidate does not match any existing candidate add it to
        # the candidate list
        if candidate_name not in candidate_options:

            # Add the candidate name to the candidate list.
            candidate_options.append(candidate_name)

            # And begin tracking that candidate's voter count.
            candidate_votes[candidate_name] = 0

        # Add a vote to that candidate's count
        candidate_votes[candidate_name] += 1

        # 4a: Write an if statement that checks that the
        # county does not match any existing county in the county list.
        if county_name not in county_options:

            # 4b: Add the existing county to the list of counties.
            county_options.append(county_name)

            # 4c: Begin tracking the county's vote count.
            county_votes[county_name] = 0

        # 5: Add a vote to that county's vote count.
        county_votes[county_name] += 1

# Save the results to our text file.

## Election Audit Summary

This script can be easily adapted for elections in all catergories city-wide, county-wide, and state-wide. To ensure accuracy, efficiency, and cost-avings, I suggest implementing this method for all elections going forward. To use for city-wide elections, for example, the county results could be taken out and instead only the results of the city-wide election could be shown. The code needs to be updated to take into consideration the unlikely event of a tie. You will see in the python code, I have done this for the county data. This could also be applied for the popular vote data in any type of election.
